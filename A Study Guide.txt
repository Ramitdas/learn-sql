SQL (Structured Query Language): A language designed for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data from databases.
Database: A structured collection of data, typically organized into tables.
Relational Database Management System (RDBMS): A software system used to create, manage, and interact with relational databases using SQL.
Table: A collection of related data held in a structured format within a database. It consists of columns and rows.
Row (Record): A single entry or instance of data in a table, representing a complete set of values for each column.
Column (Property/Attribute): A vertical entity in a table that contains all the data of a particular type for all records.
Keyword: Reserved words in SQL that have special meaning, such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE.
Semicolon (;): Used to terminate SQL statements, especially when writing multiple queries in one file.
String: A sequence of characters; in SQL, strings are enclosed in single quotes.
CREATE DATABASE: A SQL command used to create a new database.
DROP DATABASE: A SQL command used to delete an entire database.
USE: A SQL command used to select the database that subsequent queries will operate on.
CREATE TABLE: A SQL command used to create a new table within a database.
Data Type: Specifies the type of data that a column can hold (e.g., INT for integers, VARCHAR for variable-length strings).
ALTER TABLE: A SQL command used to modify the structure of an existing table (e.g., add, delete, or modify columns).
NOT NULL: A constraint that ensures a column cannot have a NULL (empty) value.
AUTO_INCREMENT: A property for a column (typically an ID) that automatically generates a unique number for each new record inserted.
Primary Key: A column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It cannot contain NULL values and must contain unique values.
Foreign Key: A column or set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key in another table, establishing a link between them.
INSERT INTO: A SQL command used to add new rows (records) into a table.
VALUES: Used with INSERT INTO to specify the data values to be inserted.
SELECT: A SQL command used to retrieve data from one or more tables.
Asterisk (*): A wildcard character used in SELECT statements to indicate that all columns should be retrieved.
LIMIT: A clause used with SELECT to restrict the number of rows returned by a query.
AS (Alias): A keyword used to give a temporary name (alias) to a column or a table in a query's result set.
ORDER BY: A clause used with SELECT to sort the results based on one or more columns in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.
DISTINCT: A keyword used with SELECT to return only unique (non-duplicate) values in the specified column(s).
UPDATE: A SQL command used to modify existing data in a table.
SET: Used with UPDATE to specify which columns to modify and their new values.
WHERE Clause: A clause used in SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements to filter records based on specified conditions.
Wildcard (%): A character used in LIKE conditions to represent zero or more unknown characters in a string pattern.
LIKE: An operator used in WHERE clauses to search for a specified pattern in a column.
OR: A logical operator used in WHERE clauses to combine multiple conditions, returning true if any of the conditions are true.
AND: A logical operator used in WHERE clauses to combine multiple conditions, returning true only if all conditions are true.
BETWEEN: An operator used in WHERE clauses to select values within a given range (inclusive).
IS NULL: An operator used in WHERE clauses to check for NULL values.
DELETE FROM: A SQL command used to remove rows (records) from a table.
JOIN: A clause used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
ON: Used with JOIN to specify the condition for joining tables.
INNER JOIN: Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
LEFT JOIN: Returns all rows from the left table, and the matching rows from the right table. If there is no match, NULL is returned for columns from the right table.
RIGHT JOIN: Returns all rows from the right table, and the matching rows from the left table. If there is no match, NULL is returned for columns from the left table.
Aggregate Function: A function that performs a calculation on a set of values (e.g., AVG for average, SUM for total, COUNT for number of rows).
GROUP BY: A clause that groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows, often used with aggregate functions.
HAVING: A clause used to filter the results of a GROUP BY clause based on a specified condition that applies to aggregate functions. It acts like WHERE but for grouped data.
